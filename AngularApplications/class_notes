AngularApplications.
    - By using AngularJS We Can Create Two Types Of Angular Applications.

1.Static Angular Application
2.Dynamic Angular Application.

Static Angular Application.

    - If View Won't Interacts with the Controller for Dynamic Data , Then Such Type Of
      Angular Application called as Static Angular Application.


Dynamic Angular Application.

    - If View Interacts with the Controller for Dynamic Data Then Such Type Of Angular Application
      called as Dynamic Angular Application.


bower.
    - Bower is the Automation plugin given by the NodeJS , used to download the Required
      Resources to Develop web application.

bower components.

1. bower.json
2. .bowerrc

bower.json.
-
    - used to write the required dependencies to develop web application.

{
    "name":"nareshit",
    "dependencies":{
        "angular" : "~1.6.0",
        "bootstrap" : "~3.3.7"
    }

}

.bowerrc
-
    - used to locate the path to the resources downloading by using bower.

{
   "directory":"bower_components"
}


    - we can run the bower components by using NodeJS Command.

      >bower install

    - when ever we run the "bower" , bower automatically connects with the "GitHub"
      with Git Interface tool.

    - "~" used to download the latest version of required resources with the help
      of GitHub.

    - "^" used to download the exact version of required resources with the help of GitHub.

Steps to Create the Static Angular Application.
-

Step 1.
    Download the Angular Framework by using bower.


Step 2.
    Create the View with following directives.
    1.ng-app
    2.ng-model
    3.ng-bind

index.html
-
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html ng-app>
    <input type="number" ng-model="obj_one"> <br><br>
    <input type="number" ng-model="obj_two"> <br><br>
    <h1 style="color:red" ng-bind="obj_one+obj_two"></h1>
    <script src="bower_components/angular/angular.min.js"></script>
</html>

    - Framework starts the execution from ng-app directive
    - if our application static , we won't specify the logical name for the web application.
    - ng-model directive will creates objects in "heap memory" with dynamic data.
    - ng-bind directive binds the "model data" to the "view".

Steps to Create the Dynamic Angular Application.
-
Step 1.
      Download the Angular Framework by using bower.

Step 2.
      Load the Angular Framework.

Step 3.
    Declare the logical name for the web application by using ng-app directive.

Step 4.
    Declare the Controller by using "ng-controller" directive.


Step 5.
    Get the Entire Webpage Control (index.html) / Instantiate the application module


Step 6.
    Implement the Controller
